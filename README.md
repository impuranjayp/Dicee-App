# Dicee ðŸŽ²

## THe Goal

The objective of this app is to create a Dice rolling App that inturn introduces us to the core programming concepts in Flutter that will form the foundation of most of the apps built in the future. This app enables us to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What was created

A Las Vegas dice app was made. The die rolls at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, any score can be settled on the go!
